# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

KeyKeeper is a security-focused API key management application built with enterprise-grade security practices. We take security seriously and have implemented multiple layers of protection to ensure your API keys remain safe.

## üîê Security Architecture

### Encryption
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM with authenticated encryption
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256, 100,000 iterations (OWASP recommended)
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with adaptive cost factor
- **Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure random number generation (OsRng)
- **Storage**: All data encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-layer Authentication**: User account + Master password
- **Session Management**: Configurable session timeouts with automatic lock
- **Access Control**: Vault-level access control with unlock/lock mechanisms
- **Password Policy**: Configurable minimum length and complexity requirements

### Audit & Monitoring
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: All security events logged with timestamps
- **Access Logging**: Failed and successful authentication attempts tracked
- **Data Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of stored data
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable log retention with automatic cleanup

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

### How to Report a Vulnerability

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email**: Send details to `security@keykeeper.app`
3. **PGP Key**: Available at `https://keykeeper.app/.well-known/pgp-key.asc`
4. **Include**: 
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Your contact information

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 48 hours
- **Regular Updates**: Every 5 business days
- **Resolution Target**: 90 days for critical vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

- Allow reasonable time for investigation and remediation
- Avoid accessing or modifying data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the issue
- Do not perform destructive testing
- Keep vulnerability details confidential until public disclosure is agreed upon

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing
- **Static Analysis**: Semgrep security patterns scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit and cargo audit for known vulnerabilities
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanner
- **SAST Integration**: Integrated into CI/CD pipeline

### Manual Security Testing
- Regular penetration testing by third-party security firms
- Code reviews with security focus
- Threat modeling and risk assessments

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Configuration

### Secure Deployment

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# NEVER commit these to version control
VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<secure-random-256-bit-key>
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<secure-random-256-bit-key>
TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64-encoded-private-key>
```

#### Network Security
```bash
# VSCode Integration - localhost only
VSCODE_SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
VSCODE_SERVER_PORT=27182

# Session Configuration
SESSION_TIMEOUT=3600          # 1 hour
AUTO_LOCK_TIMEOUT=900         # 15 minutes
```

#### Security Headers
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'
```

### Password Requirements
- **Minimum Length**: 8 characters (configurable)
- **Complexity**: Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- **History**: Previous passwords cannot be reused
- **Expiration**: Configurable password expiration policies

## üöÄ Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Secure Coding Practices
1. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
2. **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding to prevent injection attacks
3. **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages
4. **Logging**: Audit all security-relevant events
5. **Dependencies**: Regular updates and vulnerability scanning

#### Secret Management
1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** or dedicated secret management
3. **Rotate keys regularly** using provided scripts
4. **Principle of least privilege** for access control

### For System Administrators

#### Deployment Security
1. **Secure Installation**: Follow enterprise installation guide
2. **Network Isolation**: Deploy in secure network segments
3. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
4. **Backups**: Encrypted backups with secure key management
5. **Updates**: Regular security updates and patch management

#### Access Control
1. **Role-Based Access**: Implement appropriate user roles
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enable MFA for all users
3. **Session Management**: Configure appropriate timeouts
4. **Audit Reviews**: Regular access and audit log reviews

### For End Users

#### Account Security
1. **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, complex passwords
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep application updated
3. **Secure Environment**: Use trusted devices and networks
4. **Lock When Away**: Enable auto-lock and manual locking
5. **Report Issues**: Report suspicious activity immediately

## üìä Security Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Vulnerability Resolution Time**: Average time to fix security issues
- **Patch Deployment Time**: Time from patch availability to deployment
- **Audit Compliance**: Percentage of required audit controls implemented
- **Incident Response Time**: Mean time to detect and respond to incidents
