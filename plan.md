1. Market Research & Positioning
1. Analyse developer–centric secret managers (Doppler, HashiCorp Vault, 1Password Secrets Automation, EnvKey).  
2. Define personas:  
   • Solo OSS/indie devs (local-first, free).  
   • Small teams & startups (collaboration, VSCode, CI).  
   • Regulated enterprise (audit, SSO, compliance).  
3. Craft positioning statement: “KeyKeeper – the **local-first, end-to-end-encrypted secret manager that feels like a native dev tool**.”  
4. Validate with 15–20 qualitative interviews and developer surveys.
2. Differentiated Core Value Proposition
Leverage existing tech stack:  
• Tauri v2 → tiny, blazing-fast cross-platform desktop app.  
• Rust AES-256 / bcrypt security → provable local protection.  
• Deep VSCode extension (live insert, .env drag-and-drop).  
Highlight: *zero cloud lock-in, opt-in sync, true offline mode*, enterprise-grade audit.  
Package these as headline benefits across website, docs, store listings.
3. Tiered Feature Roadmap
Community (free, OSS): local vault, VSCode plugin, basic backups.  
Pro (subscription ≈ $8 / user / mo):  
• End-to-end cloud sync (E2EE), multi-device.  
• Auto-rotation & expiration alerts.  
• GitHub/GitLab CI secrets injection.  
• Dark theme, AI-assisted secret naming.  
Enterprise (custom pricing):  
• SSO/SAML, SCIM provisioning.  
• Role-based access, per-secret ACL.  
• SOC 2 & ISO 27001 reports, on-prem mode.  
• Advanced audit API, SIEM export.  
Timeline: ship Pro MVP in 3 months, Enterprise in 6–9 months.
4. Monetization & Pricing Model
1. Freemium open-core; revenue from Pro & Enterprise tiers.  
2. Monthly & annual billing via Stripe; seat-based.  
3. VSCode Marketplace: free core extension, in-extension upgrade flow.  
4. Optional self-hosted Enterprise license with annual maintenance.  
5. Marketplace revenue share for JetBrains & GitHub IDE plugins later.
5. Technical Execution Roadmap
Short-term (0-3 mo):  
• Replace demo crypto with production-grade Argon2id + AES-256-GCM (already scaffolded).  
• Implement encrypted sync service (Rust Axum + LibSQL LiteFS).  
• Add multi-vault & team invite flows (Zustand + Tauri secure FS).  
Mid-term (3-6 mo):  
• CLI & GitHub Action to inject secrets at build time.  
• JetBrains plugin via Tauri-egui or Kotlin.  
• Browser extension (Manifest v3, WASM crypto).  
Long-term (6-12 mo):  
• Automatic key rotation adapters (AWS, GCP, Azure, Stripe).  
• Pluggable storage back-ends (S3, self-hosted MinIO).  
All stages must keep 100 % test coverage for crypto core; add mutation tests.
6. Go-to-Market Launch Plan
1. Soft beta with 100 early-access users via Discord & PH *Coming Soon*.  
2. Public launch on Product Hunt, Hacker News, Dev.to, Reddit r/devops.  
3. Content marketing: weekly blog posts (“Secrets management best practices with Tauri & Rust”).  
4. Conference booths / talks (AllThingsOpen, KubeCon, RustConf).  
5. Partnerships: Tauri Foundation showcase, VSCode featured extensions, Gitpod & Codespaces templates.
7. Sales Funnel & Growth Loops
Top: SEO, content, marketplace discovery.  
Middle: Self-serve onboarding wizard with in-app checklist (KeyKeeper store.ts has UI flags).  
Bottom: In-app upsell banner when team > 3 users or > 50 secrets.  
Growth: referral credits (1 free month per referral), GitHub badge “Secured by KeyKeeper”.
8. Telemetry, Metrics & Experimentation
1. Opt-in anonymized analytics module (already in EnterpriseSettings.analytics).  
2. Track AARRR metrics: Activation (vault created), Retention (weekly active), Revenue (conversion), Referral, Reactivation.  
3. A/B experiments via remote config (feature flags served from Rust API).  
4. Weekly KPI dashboard in Metabase / Grafana.
9. Community & Support
• GitHub Discussions + Discord for OSS support.  
• Docs site (Next.js static export) with code samples & recipes.  
• Monthly community call, accept PRs labelled “good first issue”.  
• Paid SLA for Enterprise (24 h response, dedicated channel).  
• Bug bounty via HackerOne after SOC 2 readiness.
10. Compliance & Enterprise Readiness
1. Initiate SOC 2 Type II audit (outsourced firm) after telemetry pipeline hardened.  
2. GDPR & CCPA data-processing agreements.  
3. Threat-model review, penetration tests twice a year.  
4. Document security posture in SECURITY.md and white-paper PDF for sales.
11. Funding & Partnership Strategy
• Bootstrap to $20k MRR; then seed round from dev-tool focused VCs (e.g., a16z Dev Tools, OSS Capital).  
• Explore Tauri Foundation grant.  
• OEM partnerships with workstation vendors (System76) bundling KeyKeeper.  
• Offer white-label SDK for other dev tools.
